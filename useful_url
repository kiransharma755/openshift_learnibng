Make a note of the full file path to the custom version of Python you just installed. If you've followed the instructions in the installation article, the full path is:
[server]$ which python3
/home/username/opt/python-3.6.2/bin/python
Navigate to your site's directory, where you'll create the new virtual environment:
[server]$ cd ~/example.com
Create the virtual environment while you specify the version of Python you wish to use. The following command creates 'my_project' in the first path, and uses the -p flag to specify the full path to the Python3 version you just installed:
[server]$ virtualenv ~/example.com/my_project -p /home/example_username/opt/python-3.6.2/bin/python3

Running virtualenv with interpreter /home/example_username/opt/python-3.6.2/bin/python3
Using base prefix '/home/example_username/opt/python-3.6.2'
New python executable in /home/example_username/example.com/env/bin/python3
Also creating executable in /home/example_username/example.com/env/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.
This command creates a local copy of your environment specific to this website. While working on this website, you should activate the local environment in order to make sure you're working with the right versions of your tools and packages.
To activate the new virtual environment, run the following:
[server]$ source my_project/bin/activate
The name of the current virtual environment appears to the left of the prompt. For example:
(my_project) [server]$ 
To verify the correct Python version, run the following:
[server]$ python -V
Python 3.6.2
Any package that you install using pip is now placed in the virtual environments project folder, isolated from the global Python installation.

Deactivating your virtualenv
When finished working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by running the following:

[server]$ deactivate
This puts you back into your Shell user's default settings.
Deleting your virtual environment
To delete a virtual environment, simply delete the project folder. Using the previous example, run the following command:

[server]$ rm -rf /home/username/example.com/my_project
Installing custom modules
View the following article for information on how to use pip to install Python modules.

Using pip to install Python 3 modules

========
The easiest way I've found to install pip3 (for python3.x packages) on CentOS 7 is:

$ sudo yum install python34-setuptools
$ sudo easy_install-3.4 pip
You'll need to have the EPEL repository enabled before hand, of course.

You should now be able to run commands like the following to install packages for python3.x:

$ pip3 install foo


======or we can do 
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3.6
Or wget eg
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python3.6 get-pip.py
now, you can use pip3

$ pip3
